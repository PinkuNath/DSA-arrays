# DSA-arrays
## Overview
- Foundation of most data structures
- Used heavily in algorithms
- Required for efficient problem solving
## Memory Structure
- Linear data structure
- Stores same type of elements
- Uses contiguous memory
## Key Characteristics
- Fixed size
- Index-based access
- Zero-based indexing
## Internal Working
- Elements are stored in contiguous memory
- Address calculated using index
- Direct access without traversal
## Operations
- Traversal (forward, backward)
- Insertion (first, middle, last)
- Deletion (first, middle, last)
- Searching
- Updating
## Time Complexity (General)
- Traversal: **O(n)**
- Access/Updating: **O(1)**
- Search:
  1. Linear Search: **O(n)**
  2. Binary Search: **O(log n)** *(only for sorted array)*
- Insertion/Deletion:
  1. Last Position: **O(1)** *(no shifting required)*
  2. Any given position except last: **O(n)** *(requires shifting)*
## Advantages
- Fast access
- Simple structure
- Efficient for fixed-sized data
## Limitations
- Fixed size
- Inefficient insert/delete
- Memory wastage possible
## Common Mistakes
- Index out of bounds
- Wrong loop limits
- Using arrays for dynamic data
## Applications
- Data storage
- Buffers
- Matrices
- Base for other data structures
## Learning Outcome
- Clear understanding of array behaviour
- Ability to analyze and apply array-based solutions
## Future Scope
- Optimization techniques
- Comparison with linked lists
- Advanced array problems
